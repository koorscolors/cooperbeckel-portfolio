                    <p>
                        Born in Los Angeles as a test tube baby through the process of cryo-in-vitro fertilization, my entry into the world was marked by innovation and a hint of the extraordinary. Frozen for 17 months before beginning my journey, I was introduced to life within a vibrant community brimming with actors, surfers, artists, and musicians. This creative melting pot not only shaped my early years but also instilled in me an intrinsic appreciation for art in all its forms.
                        <br/>
                        Growing up, I was immersed in a plethora of artistic and cultural experiences, from playing in the LA youth orchestra to engaging in the camaraderie of high school football. This diverse background served as a fertile ground for my burgeoning interest in art, dialogue, and the exploration of ideas. Pursuing this passion led me to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts in Boston, where I delved into a Fine Arts degree that was as much about postmodern theory and discourse as it was about the practice of art itself. My education, deeply rooted in concept and dialogue, encouraged me to explore various mediums, including drawing, writing, videography, and digital tools, though my curiosity didn't stop there; I dabbled in nearly every artistic medium available to me.
                        <br/>
                        After graduation, driven by a mix of ambition and the pursuit of good ideas, I moved to San Francisco without a clear direction, other than to seek my future. It was here, amid the city's tech-driven ethos, and gold rush foundations, that my path took an unexpected turn towards the burgeoning field of AI; I ended up working in technical operations at a self-driving vehicle company. This role was not just a job to me, but a gateway to entirely new realms of the real; my imagination and technical prowess expanded, and I viewed the work from an artists lens and cosmology. My work in creating human-labeled datasets for AI systems was a veritable fusion of art and technology (and after my sixth year at the company one would be hard-pressed to find many people who had made more data for self-driving as I had). This experience allowed me to see data as an artist sees paint: essential to the act of creation.
                        <br/>
                        During my time in San Francisco, I also ventured into the entrepreneurial world with an attempt to start a startup focused on face-swapping technology, 'Advertar'. Though not all endeavors lead to success, this experience was invaluable in opening my mind to the vast potential of digital innovation.
                        <br/>
                        Now, with a move to New York and a transition to remote work, I find myself reflecting on the digital age's deep-rooted influence on our lives. The systems of systems that define our era, intricate and beyond the control of any individual, fascinate me. My focus has shifted towards understanding and exploring the cultural implications of AI in the United States during the 21st century. My partnership with a successful artist, who has become both my muse and collaborator, enriches this journey, blending the realms of art and technology for me even more; I live every day navigating the marriage of these things.
                        <br/>
                        This website serves as a portal into my explorations and insights at the intersection of art, technology, and societal shifts. It is a reflection of my journey from a test tube baby to a thinker and creator at the forefront of digital innovation, always seeking to expand the boundaries of what is possible. Through my work and this platform, I aim to contribute to the dialogue on how the digital age is ingrained within us, exploring the systems beyond our perception and control, with the hope of illuminating new paths forward in this complex, interconnected world.
